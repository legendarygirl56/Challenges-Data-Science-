You will build a photo collage using 5 images of pokemon as given in the dataset. The sample collage image and images to use in the collage are given in the Dataset folder.

You need to resize each pokemon 200X200 before using it. The final image should have size 430 X 430 px

(10 border + 200 pokemon + 10 border + 200 pokemon + 10 border = 430 px) along row and column.
